# NZ-Tariff

This is an ongoing attempt to extract the tariff information from
the text rendering of the publication files.

The characters used for the hyphen levels are really inconsistent

Aim this year is to extract the MFN and main group of Preference rates
MFN will be one of three levels (5, 10, Free) or a special rate and the
preference will be Free or a special rate, or an echo of the MFN shown as
two dots ..
