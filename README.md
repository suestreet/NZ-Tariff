# NZ-Tariff

This is an ongoing attempt to extract the tariff information from
the text rendering of the publication files.

The characters used for the hyphen levels are really inconsistent. This
possibly arises from using a hyphen and 'lifting' to create the en dash.

Currently will extract to 8 digits.

Next step to extract to 11 digit

Export to xml
